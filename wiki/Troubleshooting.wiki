#summary Post a comment to this page if you have problem using Flash-VideoIO

  # *Problem:* with Adobe Flash Player on Mac OS X, it does not detect the camera "Built-in iSight" if you have installed Google Video Chat plugin. The problem is even after I changed my code to select the new camera name, it does not work well on Mac OS X. 
    * The best option for now is to remove Google Video Chat and make sure that your Flash Player settings show only one camera "Built-in iSight", or 
    * go back to older version of Flash Player `10.0.45` which uses "USB Video Class Video" as camera name. 
    * Please see this [http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2666849&tstart=2 forum post] about potential fixes. 
    * Please see another [http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=12579808 forum post] on the problem and potential fix.
    * Some people have suggested installing Flash Player [http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html 10.2 beta] but that caused newer problems for me.
