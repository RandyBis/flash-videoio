#summary Post a comment to this page if you have problem using Flash-VideoIO

  * Problem with Adobe Flash Player on Mac OS X that it does not detect the camera "Built-in iSight" if you have installed Google Video Chat plugin. The best option for now is to remove Google Video Chat and make sure that your Flash Player settings show only one camera. Some people have suggested installing Flash Player [http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html 10.2 beta]. Please see [http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=12579808 this forum] on the problem and potential fix.
