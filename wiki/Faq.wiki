== Is Flash application a good choice for VoIP? ==
Please see my blog article [http://p2p-sip.blogspot.com/2010/02/faq-on-using-flash-player-to-make-phone.html FAQ on using Flash player to make phone calls] for answers to these questions:

  # Is Flash application a good choice for VoIP?
  # Will there be any performance degradation when the call goes through the following paths? (Flash Client -> Media Server ->RTMP to SIP Converter -> VOIP Server -> VoIP/PSTN Gateway -> PSTN Network -> Telephone)
  # Some experts says that the development in C or C++ is prefered for VOIP call to phone instead of Flash Player for performance reason. Is that true?
  # There are different media servers available. like Adobe Flash Media server (FMS), Wowza, Red5 etc. Which one is the best choice?
  # We are now in a confusion whether to develop our VOIP application in Flash technology or QT/Java/C#. What will be your choice?

== Does it support RTMP? What about RTMFP? ==

Yes, it support both RTMP (client-server media path) and RTMFP (peer-to-peer media path). Most of the tutorial deals with RTMP. If you set the `src` property to appropriate "rtmfp" URL and set `farID` to appropriate value before setting `play`, then it enables RTMFP mode for peer-to-peer media. Please visit [http://myprojectguide.org/p/flash-videoio/9.html How to do peer-to-peer video call?] for details. Also some example applications such as iChatNow, Random-Face and Public-Chat listed on the [http://code.google.com/p/flash-videoio project page] use RTMFP using Adobe Stratus service.

== Does it support web-to-phone calls and vice-versa? ==

Yes, partially. It supports Flash-to-SIP calls and vice-versa using an external SIP-RTMP gateway such [http://code.google.com/p/siprtmp/ siprtmp.py]. You can use the extensive Javascript API to build your own web phone user interface including call control and a dial-pad for sending in-call DTMF digits. You _need_ to use your own PSTN termination provider that can terminate your SIP calls and translate to PSTN, and vice-versa. Please see [http://myprojectguide.org/p/flash-videoio/11.html How to do SIP-based VoIP calls?] for details. In summary, your termination provider must support Speex voice codec, and understand SIP, SDP and RTP.

== Can I use it to build a video call application on Facebook using FBML? ==

No. Facebook's FBML mangles Javascript. Due to this the API used to interact between Flash Player and Javascript breaks. A friend of mine is working on modifying Flash-VideoIO to make it compatible with Facebook. I will post an update when it is ready. On the other hand, you can build the application on your hosted web site, and include it in Facebook without FBML.
